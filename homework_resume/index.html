      Really?! Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE,
      PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. I love you, buddy!
      Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? To shreds, you say. Well, how is his
      wife holding up? To shreds, you say. This is the worst kind of discrimination: the
      kind against me!

        Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! And until then, I can never
        die? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. We're also Santa Claus! Oh, I
        don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and
        then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.
